# Developer Footer Implementation

## Summary
Added "Developed by Mr. Mayank Bansal" footer to all pages in the application. The footer appears at the bottom of scrollable content and is only visible when the user scrolls to the end.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Developer Footer Widget
**File:** `lib/widgets/common/developer_footer.dart`
- Created a reusable widget that displays the developer attribution
- Styled with subtle gray italic text
- Centered alignment with proper padding

### 2. Updated AppFooter Widget
**File:** `lib/widgets/app_footer.dart`
- Previously empty widget is now populated with the same developer attribution
- Used by the instruction validation screen

### 3. Integrated into Content Router Service
**File:** `lib/services/home_screen/content_router_service.dart`
- Added `DeveloperFooter` import
- Integrated footer at the bottom of the `_sectionWrapper` method
- This automatically adds the footer to ALL main workflow sections:
  - Import JSON
  - Project Parameters
  - Instruction
  - Actions
  - User ID
  - Outputs
  - Edges
  - Number of edges
  - Task.json
  - Validate Task.json
  - Result.json
  - HR Expert Interface Changer

### 4. Added to Login Screen
**File:** `lib/screens/login_screen.dart`
- Added `DeveloperFooter` import
- Integrated footer below the login card
- Visible when scrolling down on smaller screens

### 5. Added to JSON Editor Demo
**File:** `lib/screens/json_editor_demo.dart`
- Added `DeveloperFooter` import
- Placed at the bottom of the scrollable content
- Appears after the JSON editor demonstration

### 6. Fixed Instruction Validation Screen
**File:** `lib/screens/instruction_validation_screen.dart`
- Already uses `AppFooter` widget (now properly implemented)
- Footer displays correctly at the bottom

## Coverage

### ✅ Pages with Footer
- **Login Screen** - Shows below login card
- **All Main Workflow Sections** - Through ContentRouterService:

  - Actions
  - User ID
  - Outputs
  - Edges
  - Number of edges
  - Task.json
  - Validate Task.json
  - Result.json
  - HR Expert Interface Changer
- **JSON Editor Demo** - Shows after editor content
- **Instruction Validation Screen** - Shows after redirect card
- **Task Workflow Screen** - Inherits from ContentRouterService

### Implementation Details

#### Footer Appearance

- **Style:** 12px, gray, italic
- **Position:** Bottom of scrollable content, centered
- **Visibility:** Only visible when user scrolls to the bottom
- **Padding:** 24px vertical, 16px horizontal
