# Task History Feature - Temporary Disable

## Summary
The Task History feature has been temporarily hidden from the UI and its backend API calls have been disabled.

## Changes Made

### 1. Navigation Service (`lib/services/home_screen/navigation_service.dart`)
- **Hidden** the "Tasks History" navigation item from the left navigation menu
- Commented out: `NavItem('Tasks History', Icons.history, sectionKey: 'tasks_history')`
- Adjusted `utilityToolsStartIndex` from 12 to 11 to account for the hidden item

### 2. Content Router Service (`lib/services/home_screen/content_router_service.dart`)
- **Commented out** the import for `task_history_screen.dart`
- **Removed** the Tasks History case (case 0) from the content router
- **Adjusted** all subsequent case numbers down by 1 to match the new navigation structure

### 3. Task History Provider (`lib/providers/task_history_provider.dart`)
- **Disabled** all API calls by adding early returns with debug messages
- Methods disabled:
  - `loadTasksForUser()` - Returns immediately without making API call
  - `loadTasksByStatus()` - Returns immediately without making API call
  - `loadRecentTasks()` - Returns immediately without making API call
  - `loadTaskStatistics()` - Returns null immediately without making API call
  - `getTaskDetails()` - Returns null immediately without making API call
- Added `// ignore` comments for unused private methods to suppress warnings

### 4. API Service (`lib/services/api_service.dart`)
- **Added** a feature flag: `_taskHistoryApiEnabled = false`
- **Modified** all Task History API methods to check this flag first:
  - `getTasksForUser()` - Returns error response if disabled
  - `getTasksByStatus()` - Returns error response if disabled
  - `getTaskStatistics()` - Returns error response if disabled
  - `getTaskDetails()` - Returns error response if disabled
  - `getRecentTasks()` - Returns error response if disabled

## How to Re-enable

To re-enable the Task History feature, follow these steps in reverse:

### Step 1: Re-enable API Service
In `lib/services/api_service.dart`:
```dart
// Change from:
static const bool _taskHistoryApiEnabled = false;
// To:
static const bool _taskHistoryApiEnabled = true;
```

### Step 2: Re-enable Task History Provider
In `lib/providers/task_history_provider.dart`:
- Remove the early returns and debug messages
- Uncomment the multi-line comments (`/* TEMPORARILY DISABLED ... */`)
- Remove the `// ignore: unused_field` and `// ignore: unused_element` comments

### Step 3: Re-enable Content Router
In `lib/services/home_screen/content_router_service.dart`:
- Uncomment the import: `import '../../screens/task_history_screen.dart';`
- Add back case 0 for Tasks History
- Adjust all subsequent case numbers up by 1

### Step 4: Re-enable Navigation
In `lib/services/home_screen/navigation_service.dart`:
- Uncomment: `NavItem('Tasks History', Icons.history, sectionKey: 'tasks_history')`
- Change `utilityToolsStartIndex` from 11 back to 12

## Impact

### User-Facing Changes
- ✅ Tasks History tab is **hidden** from the left navigation menu
- ✅ Users cannot access the Tasks History screen
- ✅ No backend calls are made to fetch task history data

### Backend Impact
- ✅ No API calls to `/api/tasks-history/*` endpoints will be made from the frontend
- ℹ️ Backend endpoints remain functional but are not called

### Development Impact
- ✅ All compile errors resolved
- ✅ No lint warnings
- ✅ Feature can be re-enabled quickly by reversing the changes

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify Tasks History is not visible in left navigation
- [ ] Verify no console errors when navigating the app
- [ ] Verify no network calls to `/api/tasks-history/*` endpoints
- [ ] Verify all other navigation items work correctly
- [ ] Verify the app loads and functions normally

## Notes
- This is a **temporary** disable, not a removal
- All code remains in place and can be re-enabled quickly
- The TaskHistoryScreen component itself is not modified
- The route `/tasks` in main.dart is still registered but not accessible via UI navigation
