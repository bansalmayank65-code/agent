# Task Refiner - Progress Steps UI Enhancement

## Overview
Added real-time progress indicators to the Task Refiner tool to show users exactly what steps are being performed during the refinement process.

## New Features

### 1. Step-by-Step Progress Display
A visual progress indicator now shows:
- Current step being executed (with spinner)
- Completed steps (with checkmarks)
- Overall status (Refining... / Refinement Complete)

### 2. Progress Steps Shown

The tool displays these refinement steps in real-time:

1. **Validating JSON structure...** ✓
   - Parses and validates the input JSON
   - Ensures task contains required fields

2. **Merging duplicate actions...** ✓
   - Identifies duplicate actions by name and arguments
   - Keeps first occurrence, removes duplicates

3. **Moving audit log actions to end...** ✓
   - Identifies all audit log related actions
   - Reorders them to the end while preserving their order

4. **Generating edges from action dependencies...** ✓
   - Uses EdgeGenerator to calculate edges
   - Analyzes input/output relationships

5. **Calculating num_of_edges...** ✓
   - Counts generated edges
   - Updates the num_of_edges field

6. **Formatting refined task...** ✓
   - Pretty-prints JSON with indentation
   - Displays in right editor

### 3. Clear Button
Added a "Clear" button to reset:
- Both editors (Original and Refined)
- Progress steps
- Current state

## UI Design

### Progress Box
```

## Visual Feedback

### Colors
- **Blue (#1890ff)**: Current step in progress
- **Green**: Completed steps
- **Light blue background (#e6f7ff)**: Progress box
- **Blue border (#91d5ff)**: Progress box border

### Icons
- 🔄 Spinner: Current step

## Code Changes

### New State Variables
```dart
String currentStep = '';
List<String> completedSteps = [];
```

### New Methods
```dart
void _updateStep(String step)  // Update current step
void _resetSteps()             // Clear all steps
```

### Enhanced _refineTask Method
- Shows progress for each refinement operation
- Includes small delays for better UX visibility
- Tracks completed vs current steps
- Resets on error or completion

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Transparency**: Users can see exactly what's happening
2. **Progress Tracking**: Visual confirmation of each step
3. **Error Context**: Users know at which step an error occurred
4. **Clear State**: New "Clear" button for easy reset
5. **Professional Look**: Polished UI matching enterprise standards

## Technical Details

### Timing
- Each step shows for ~300ms minimum
- Allows users to see progress even with fast backend
- Final formatting step: 200ms

### State Management
- Steps tracked in component state
- Progress box conditionally rendered
- Automatic cleanup on errors

### Responsive Design
- Progress box appears below controls
- Expands/collapses based on state
- Doesn't interfere with main editors

## File Modified
- `frontend/lib/screens/task_refiner_screen.dart`

## Benefits

✅ **Better UX**: Users know the tool is working  
✅ **Debugging**: See which step fails if error occurs  
✅ **Trust**: Transparency builds confidence  
✅ **Professional**: Enterprise-grade user experience  
✅ **Informative**: Educational - users learn what happens  

## Example Usage Flow

1. User pastes task.json in left editor
2. User clicks "Refine" button
3. Progress box appears showing "Refining..."
4. Each step shows with spinner, then checkmark
5. Final step completes
6. Progress box shows "Refinement Complete"
7. Refined task appears in right editor
8. User can click "Clear" to start over

The tool now provides a much more engaging and informative user experience! 🎉
